#  ATM Interface

## Project Abstract
<p>
We have all come across ATMs in our cities and it is built on Java. This complex project consists of five different classes and is a console-based application. When the system starts the user is prompted with user id and user pin. On entering the details successfully, then ATM functionalities are unlocked. The project allows to perform following operations:

* Transactions History
* Withdraw
* Deposit
* Transfer
* Quit 
</p>

## Project Relevance

<p>
I believe this project proposal can educate the team members with project management, building, testing, issue tracking. With being a project this big, it is important to split each task to each team members accordingly. Each team member should keep track of how they are building and testing it and also what they are coding. When they are combining codes together, they should track what issue they might come in play. An ATM program should have a tons of classes and inheritance come in play. This can also inspire others for great ideas as well. This learning goal is important because in the big companies, being able to work well in a team is very important. This is like a baby step for it.

## Conceptual Design
<p>
The objective of this proposal is to educate the team members and I to sharpen the skills of working in a team for a programming project. Many of the program done as students were mainly done by individually. By proposing this, this can give students like me a better idea of software development where as a team can combine ideas to build a better software.

### Building

* The program was unable to build due unable to locate class DepositSlot. 
* There is an instance of DepositSlot which does not exist in the program

### Running
* Does not contain every class needed to run
